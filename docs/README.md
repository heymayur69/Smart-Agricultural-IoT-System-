## 📘 Overview

The **Smart Agricultural IoT System** is a real-time precision irrigation setup designed using **Arduino UNO**, **ESP8266**, and **multi-sensor data fusion** for optimized water usage.  

It automates irrigation using soil moisture, water level, environmental parameters, and a scheduled RTC clock—achieving:

- 💧 **35% water conservation**  
- ⚡ **70% power reduction (deep sleep + optimized polling)**  
- 📡 **Cloud monitoring using ESP8266 + ThingSpeak**  
- 📟 **LCD-based live monitoring for field usage**

A perfect practical model for farms, IoT learning, college projects, and agricultural automation.
